# Greatest Common Divisor
Implementation of Greatest Common Divisor function using Euclid algorithm

Code is implemented in gcd.py, written for Python 2.7.x

This code expects the input from the std input to have an integer representing the number of integer pairs to 
process on the first line. The remaining lines should include a space separated intege pairs to calculate GCD for

See test_data.txt for a sample of the input file

To use the files provided use:
python gcd.py < test_data.txt
