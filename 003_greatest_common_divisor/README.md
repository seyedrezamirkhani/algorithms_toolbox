# Greatest Common Divisor
Implementation of Greatest Common Divisor function using Euclid algorithm

Code is implemented in gcd.py, written for Python 2.7.x

This code expects the input from the std input to have an integer representing the number of integer pairs to 
process on the first line. The remaining lines should include a space separated integer pairs, largest first, to calculate GCD for. The calculated GCD value is written to a new line on the std output for each integer pair.

See test_data.txt for a sample of the input file.

Use the command below to run and test the code:
python gcd.py < test_data.txt
